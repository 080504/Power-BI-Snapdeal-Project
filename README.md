# Power-BI-Snapdeal-Project
📊 Snapdeal E-Commerce Data Analysis using Power BI
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Snapdeal e-commerce product data using Power BI to uncover meaningful business insights related to pricing, discounts, and customer ratings. The goal is to help stakeholders understand how discounts and prices influence customer perception and purchasing behavior.

The analysis is designed from a real-world business perspective, similar to dashboards used by e-commerce managers and analysts.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze how discounts vary across price ranges

Identify high and low discount products using conditional formatting

Compare average price vs average rating across subcategories

Evaluate whether higher discounts actually improve customer ratings

Track discount trends over time

Interpret key KPIs from a business decision-making viewpoint

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Power BI Desktop

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

Excel / CSV Dataset

Data Visualization & Business Analytics

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains product-level information from Snapdeal, including:

Product Name

Price

Discount

Rating

Subcategory

Scraping Date (assumed for time-based analysis)

📈 Tasks & Analysis Performed
✅ Task 1: Discount vs Price Analysis

Visual Used: Scatter Plot

Insight: Both price and discount are continuous variables, making scatter plots ideal for identifying correlation, clusters, and outliers.

✅ Task 2: Conditional Formatting in Table

Applied conditional formatting:

Discounts above 50 highlighted in green

Discounts below 10 highlighted in red

Ratings below 3 highlighted in orange

Improves quick identification of high-risk and high-opportunity products.

✅ Task 3: Average Price vs Average Rating by Subcategory

Visual Used: Clustered Column + Line Combo Chart

Insight: Some expensive categories show lower ratings, indicating a possible mismatch between price and perceived value.

✅ Task 4: Do Higher Discounts Lead to Higher Ratings?

Visuals Used: Scatter Plot with Trend Line & Supporting Bar Chart

Finding: Higher discounts do not consistently lead to higher ratings.

Conclusion: Customer satisfaction is influenced more by quality and experience than discounts alone.

✅ Task 5: Discount Trend Over Time

Visual Used: Line Chart

Insight: Helps track promotional cycles, seasonal trends, and discount stability over time.

✅ Task 6: KPI Interpretation

KPIs Analyzed:

Average Price

Average Discount

Average Rating

Business Insight:

Aggressive discounting improves affordability but does not guarantee high customer satisfaction.

E-commerce managers should balance pricing, quality, and customer experience instead of relying only on discounts.

📊 Key Business Insights

Discounts alone are not enough to improve ratings

High-priced categories must justify value through quality

Over-discounting can impact margins without improving perception

Data-driven pricing strategies lead to better long-term performance
